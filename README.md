## Objectives
1. **Data Generation:** Create a diverse and realistic dataset with 10,000+ rows.
2. **Demographic Analysis:** Identify trends based on location, college, and year of study.
3. **Program Analysis:** Compare interest levels for various e-learning programs.
4. **Projections:** Predict lead conversion rates and suggest a budget allocation strategy.
5. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the dataset for meaningful analysis.
6. **Findings Presentation:** Summarize insights with visualizations and actionable recommendations.

## Dataset Details
The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Lead ID:** Unique identifier for each lead.
- **Location:** City or region the lead is from.
- **College:** Name of the college/university.
- **Year of Study:** Year of study (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th).
- **Program Interest:** E-learning program the lead is interested in (e.g., Data Science, Robotics).
- **Lead Source:** Acquisition source (e.g., Instagram, LinkedIn).
